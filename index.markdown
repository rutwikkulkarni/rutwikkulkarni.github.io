Hi! I'm Rutwik, a student with a passion for low level software programming. I'm currently on an industrial placement at MBDA UK and will be continuing my studies next year, which is Computer Science with Mathematics at the University of Leeds.

This website is primarily a place to showcase my personal projects which I have developed in my spare time. I also intend to create some blog posts in the future detailing my development journey with some of my programs.

In a world plagued with 'flavour of the month' frameworks and unnecessary libraries which bloat, I try to develop my projects with little to no dependencies in order to deepen my knowledge and know exactly what my code is doing.
