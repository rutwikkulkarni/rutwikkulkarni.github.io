## Path Tracer
A multithreaded offline path tracer which I created for curiosity and to develop my knowledge in 3D graphics. For more details, find my blog post here.

## Cube Renderer
A program which renders cubes in 3D space with Phong lighting. I challenged myself to create this from scratch in C++ (Mostly C, I only use C++  for operator overloading) with no libraries/dependencies, interfacing only with the Win32 API, OpenGL and C Runtime Library.

## GameBoy Emulator
A gameboy emulator written in C using SDL. This project is still early in development, but you can find the repo for it here.

## Procedural Terrain
A procedural terrain generator using OpenGL. It uses a variant of perlin noise to generate the random terrain.

You can find other smaller projects over at my GitHub Profile.
